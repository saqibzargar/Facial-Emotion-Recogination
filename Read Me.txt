Introduction

Facial emotion reconination FER is project which classifies the images of  various persons based on the expressions
provided in that images the emotions are catorigsed on the bases of seven universally accepted emotions(happy, sad, fear,
anger, comntempt, disguised) provided by paul ekman in 1975. In this project the facial emotion recogination is
implemented through artifical neural network ANN. The data set used in this project is FER 2013  which was the part 
of kaggel challenge in year 2013


To make this project running you need to follow these steps:-


1) download the dataset frem the link provided in the dataset file.

2) open the copy_of_fer_ist_model in google colab.

3) in notebook change the path of the dataset and run the indivisual cells

4) run the each indivisual cell in your notebook  sequentally

5)once you run all cells your model will be genrated and trainned and tested on FER2013 dataset
